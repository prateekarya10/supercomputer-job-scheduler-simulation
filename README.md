# supercomputer-job-scheduler-simulation
Simulates a supercomputer job scheduler with 128 worker nodes, managing job distribution based on queuing policies (FCFS, smallest job first, short duration) and allocation policies (first fit, best fit, worst fit). Outputs CPU and memory utilization per node to CSV, visualized with gnuplot for analysis.
